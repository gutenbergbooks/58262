<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i005.jpg" width="100" height="113" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">RICHARD LEDDAM was a
poor man, who obtained a
subsistence by toiling in all
weathers in catching fish and oysters,
which he sold to persons whose
business it was to supply the city market.
The village in which he lived was exposed
on one side to the ocean waves, the other
was washed by the calmer waters of a
bay. Here a few families were induced
to dwell, invited by the facilities for procuring
fish.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Lonely as the village was, it was not
an unpleasant spot; the grounds were
shaded by fine trees, and the constant sea
breeze rendered the atmosphere cool and
healthy. On a little indenture of the
shore, where the bay setting in formed a
cove, stood the cabin of the fisherman.
It was built of logs, and a sloping shed
protected the house from winter storms
and summer suns. Beneath this shelter
were kept, when not in use, the fishing
boat and the fishing tackle. Here too the
family assembled in fine weather, and
thence the anxious wife sent many a
wishful glance, when expecting her husband&#8217;s
return.</p>

<p>Their family consisted of two boys,
John and Henry, and three daughters.</p>

<p>Here they lived in rude comfort&mdash;poor,
but not destitute; and when, after a
successful day, the family met in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
humble home, from which they looked
out on the sparkling waters, while the
father related his adventures, they might
be called happy, as far as exemption from
care could make immortal beings happy.</p>

<p>But of his glorious birthright as an immortal
spirit, Richard Leddam thought not.
If he mentioned the name of his Creator,
it was only to profane it. There was no
prayer offered to God in that family, and
Sabbaths came and went, not reverenced,
almost unheeded. Once, while at a neighbouring
city, where he had gone with a
boat load, his little vessel was visited by
a Christian gentleman, who gave him a
Bible, which he brought to his wife; but
whether it was prized as it deserved to be,
or whether the fisherman, in his solitary
hours upon the sea, ever turned in repentance
to his God and Saviour, none can tell.</p>

<p>One boisterous day in November he left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the cove, thinking that the wind would
lull by noon. His wife remembered that
when he had gone a few steps from the
door he returned to bid them farewell
again, and placing his hand on John&#8217;s
head, told him to be good, and help his
mother.</p>

<p>The wind increased through the day,
and the tempest was fearful all night.
When the light dawned, the distressed
family beheld the boat floating upwards,&mdash;but
their only friend they never saw again.</p>

<p>With the assistance of a neighbour the
boat was drawn up, and placed in its usual
resting-place in the shed. The children
gathered around it with sorrowful faces,
as if it had been their father&#8217;s coffin. The
mother looked silently on the helpless
little ones; then, leaning her face on her
hand, as she rested on the side of the boat,
she wept piteously. One of the neighbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
perceiving a Bible, which lay on a
shelf, took it down and read the eleventh
chapter of John. The word of God
soothed the poor widow&#8217;s grief; and when
they were alone she said to her son, &#8216;Read
to me those good words again.&#8217; How
many sorrowful hearts have those good
words relieved!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2></div>

<p class="center"><b>THEY MOVE TO THE CITY.</b></p>


<p class="drop-cap2">THE kind neighbour who loved the
Bible, and had read it to the poor
widow, came daily to read more of the
&#8216;good words.&#8217; The clergyman too came
to visit her in her sorrow, and explained to
her the words that had soothed her even
while she understood them but imperfectly.
Mrs Leddam felt how sinful she had been
in living all her life without a thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
God, and now in her affliction she turned
to Him whom she had so long forgotten.</p>

<p>The good clergyman spoke to her of
Jesus, the Saviour of sinners, through
whom alone we can receive pardon and
peace; and the poor widow prayed to this
blessed Saviour as she had never prayed
before, and He heard her and comforted her
heart; for He has said, &#8216;Him that cometh
unto me, I will in no wise cast out.&#8217;</p>

<p>As John was too young to manage the
boat, it was sold with the nets and fishing
tackle, and the widow with her five children
removed to the neighbouring town, where
she hoped to find employment in sewing.
She hired a small house in the outskirts of
the town; and there, with her little flock
around her, she felt like a desolate stranger.</p>

<p>How little do those children who are
blessed with many comforts know of the
trials of the poor and fatherless!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>But the widow had now a source of
comfort in her trials. John daily read
some of the &#8216;good words&#8217; to his mother.
They rejoiced in God&#8217;s many promises to
the widow and the fatherless, and trusted
that He would provide. The town was
situated on the bank of a broad river, and
the widow&#8217;s cottage stood not far from the
water. Near it stood a small house, which
one would have said had been built by a
sailor; and he would have said rightly, for
Captain Sam had made his dwelling as
much like the vessel in which he had spent
his best days as he could. In front of the
house was a small porch, shaded by a sail;
and here the old man passed the most of
his time, smoking his pipe. The poor
neighbours thought that Captain Sam was
a rich man, because he could afford to do
nothing.</p>

<p>Within sight of the captain&#8217;s house was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a grocer&#8217;s shop, where every morning numbers
of poor children came to procure
supplies for the day. Among them the
captain observed John and Henry, as having
clean faces, and as being neatly dressed.
John&#8217;s attention had been attracted by the
captain&#8217;s house. He admired the bright
colour with which it was painted, and had
conceived a great respect for its happy
owner; for John, like the rest, thought it
must be very pleasant to be idle,&mdash;a great
mistake, as any one who will try it may
soon discover. Hearing the shopkeeper
call him captain, he asked, &#8216;Is he a real
captain, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How do I know, youngster?&#8217; replied
the man. &#8216;You had better ask him that
yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p>The next day, observing his mother
weeping, John said, &#8216;Mother, can&#8217;t I get
work?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>She laid her hand on his head as she
replied, &#8216;What could you do, my son?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A heap of things,&#8217; he said earnestly.
&#8216;I can help to row, and mend the nets.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But we are now far away from the
fishing. We are in a strange place, full of
people, where, in the midst of plenty, we
are likely to come to want; for this is the
last money I have in the world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, mother!&#8217; said the terrified boy,
&#8216;will they let us starve? won&#8217;t some of the
rich people help you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am going in search of work,&#8217; replied
his mother. &#8216;Take care of your brother
and sisters until I return.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;May I walk as far as the corner,
mother?&#8217;</p>

<p>Giving him permission to do so, Mrs
Leddam left the house.</p>

<p>Now John had a plan of his own, but
he was puzzled to know how to bring it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
about. He had often accompanied his
father to the vessels in the bay, and had a
strong partiality for sailors. He thought
if he could but make a friend of this rich
captain, who lived in the fine house, how
happy he should be. So, after thinking it
over, he resolved to see the captain, and
tell him how poor his mother was. Bidding
Henry watch his baby sister, he set out
for the corner; but as he walked on he
felt his courage become fainter, until his
young heart almost failed.</p>

<p>But we will turn to a new chapter to
relate his introduction to the captain.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2></div>

<p class="center"><b>JOHN MAKES SOME ACQUAINTANCES.</b></p>


<p class="drop-cap2">JOHN had not walked far when he saw
a horse galloping down the street: the
people shouted, which only made the horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
run the faster; but just as he reached the
corner, John made a spring, and, catching
the rein, in a moment he was on his back.
John&#8217;s time, when he lived at the fishing
village, had been divided between riding
ponies and paddling boats; but he had
never ridden so fine an animal as this,&mdash;his
skin shone like satin, and his saddle
and bridle were so handsome, that the
little boy concluded he must belong to
some very rich captain indeed.</p>

<p>Directly a ragged boy came up to him
with &#8216;Halloo! there, what are you doing
with my horse?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I caught him,&#8217; said John, &#8216;but I don&#8217;t
believe he belongs to you;&#8217; so, touching
his side with his heel, the spirited horse
set off at full speed, and did not stop till
he reached a handsome house, on the steps
of which stood a gentleman with a whip
in his hand, just ready for a ride. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was pleased to get his horse, and put a
shilling in John&#8217;s hand for his trouble.</p>

<p>So large a piece of money astonished
the child; his eyes glistened, and, without
knowing it, he spoke his thoughts: &#8216;Oh,
mother, you need not have cried so!&#8217;</p>

<p>The gentleman was preparing to mount
his horse, but hearing these words, he said,
&#8216;What was the matter with your mother?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She had no money to buy us bread, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Has she no work to do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We have just come here, and mother
does not know any one.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why did you come here, boy?&#8217;</p>

<p>John thought this was a foolish question,
but he answered, &#8216;Father was
drowned, and mother couldn&#8217;t fish, and
she was afraid we should starve in the
village; but I am more afraid of it here.&#8217;</p>

<p>The gentleman smiled and said, &#8216;I do
not think there is much danger of that.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>But John looked in his face with a
serious countenance, and said, &#8216;People
are obliged to starve when they have no
money. I asked the shopkeeper for one
biscuit for the baby, and he said he would
whip me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The hard-hearted fellow!&#8217; said the
stranger to himself; then, looking at his
watch, &#8216;I am hurried now, but bring your
mother here this evening.&#8217; As he spoke
he rode away; but checking his horse, he
called to John, &#8216;My little lad, have you
had your breakfast? Ah! he is gone; I
should have thought of that before.&#8217; But
happy John was already half way home.
As he passed he saw Captain Sam seated
before his door, lighting his pipe; and
he determined to stop and speak to him.
John began to think better of the towns-folk,
as he called them; and the thought
of having some money in his pocket gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
him more confidence, in which our fisherman&#8217;s
boy resembled people much older
and wiser than himself.</p>

<p>When John came near to the captain,
his heart began to beat quickly, and he
made the best bow that his country education
had taught him. It would have been
a hard heart that could not feel for him,
as he stood with his straw hat in his hand,
his brown curling hair setting off his
honest countenance, which, young as it
was, wore an expression of care. It is
sad to see trouble clouding the brow of
childhood; but He who sends affliction, will
send strength to bear it, if we ask Him.
Though John&#8217;s father had been dead but
a few weeks, he had thought more in that
short time than in his whole life before.
While he read God&#8217;s precious promises to
his mother, he learned to pray to that
merciful God, and love the kind Saviour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>No doubt it was the Lord&#8217;s kindness
which turned the heart of the old captain
toward the little fatherless boy. No sooner
did he see John&#8217;s modest bow and serious
face than he felt an interest in him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sit down on the steps, my little man,
and tell me your name. I suppose you
live in one of these cottages?&#8217;</p>

<p>John&#8217;s simple story was soon told. When
he mentioned his father&#8217;s name, the old
sailor called to his wife, &#8216;I say, Sally,
come here; this is Richard Leddam&#8217;s son:
many&#8217;s the job your father has done for
me, child. Wife, give him something to
eat; I suspect the locker at home is
empty.&#8217;</p>

<p>John&#8217;s heart had been so full that he
did not know how hungry he was, till Mrs.
Newton set before him some bacon and
bread. They smiled to see him enjoy his
meal; but all at once he stopped eating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and said, &#8216;Please, sir, let me take this to
the children, they are so hungry!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sally,&#8217; said the captain, &#8216;put some more
on the plate; as it&#8217;s but a step, we will
walk along and see poor Leddam&#8217;s little
ones.&#8217;</p>

<p>How pleased the children were when
they saw their brother, and the good
breakfast which he brought them! My
young reader, would you know the worth
of money? go feed the hungry and clothe
the poor orphan.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you been to school, John?&#8217; said
Captain Sam.</p>

<p>&#8216;Father taught me to read, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He could not have done you a better
turn, my lad; but you won&#8217;t be a land-lubber,
hey!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I would like to be a real sailor, sir, like
those I saw in the big ships in the bay.
Henry wants to be a sailor too.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; said the captain, &#8216;if you were
only a little older; but we will see.&#8217;</p>

<p>Just then the door was opened, and Mrs
Leddam returned. She was pale and sad,
but her heart seemed to revive when she
heard her visitor speak kindly to her. &#8216;It
is a great comfort,&#8217; she said, &#8216;to know that
there is one person in this strange place
that feels for these poor children. John
has been talking of you, sir, ever since
we came here; he is so bent on being a
sailor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And a sailor he shall be,&#8217; said the
captain, slapping his hands together. &#8216;I
hope you will live to see him sail his own
vessel.&#8217;</p>

<p>When their new friends were gone,
John told his mother of the message from
the strange gentleman, and gave her the
money he had received for catching the
horse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8216;You have done a better morning&#8217;s work
than I have,&#8217; she said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did you go to many places, mother?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I will eat some of this good bread, my
son, and then tell you.&#8217;</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">&#8216;I &nbsp; WENT first,&#8217; said Mrs Leddam, &#8216;to
the houses where I supposed rich
people lived.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s handsome houses in that wide
street,&#8217; interrupted John. &#8216;I saw, through
the windows, pictures hanging on the
walls, and such beautiful curtains! Did
you go to them?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I stopped at one door,&#8217; his mother replied:
&#8216;the servant was dressed as fine as
a gentleman. He looked at me with contempt,
and said his mistress had company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
At another house, I got to see the lady.
She was sitting in a velvet chair, rocking
her baby, and was handsome and pleasant
spoken, and asked me to sit down.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She gave you some work?&#8217; said John.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; replied Mrs Leddam, sighing, &#8216;I
don&#8217;t think she ever felt trouble. For a
moment she seemed sorry for me; but she
was so much taken up with her little girl,
that she seemed to forget for a while that
I was in the room, and then dismissed me
hastily, telling me to call again. As I
rung the bell at another fine house, the
mistress came out to the door, elegantly
dressed, and stepped into a carriage which
was waiting. I asked her for work, and
told her of my starving children. She
looked cross, and said there was no end to
the calls of poor people. I looked at a
bright purse which she held in her hand,
and thought that one of the gold pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that shone through the silk would make
me easy for a week. At last I felt faint
and sick, and came home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Wasn&#8217;t you glad, mother,&#8217; said Henry,
&#8216;when you found us so well off?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, my son; I felt that God had not
forsaken us. And now, John, read me
the chapter we had yesterday.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Which, mother? where Jesus fed the
five thousand?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; I love to hear that part which
speaks of women and children: surely He
will take care of us helpless ones.&#8217;</p>

<p>It has been said, and whoever feels sorrow
may know it to be true, &#8216;A dark hour makes
Jesus bright.&#8217; Before I close this chapter,
let me ask my young reader to remember
the words at the beginning, and try to put
them in practice.</p>

<p>You may not always have money to
give to the poor, but you can be kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and thoughtful. A few kind words will

<p class="center"><b>THE SPANISH SAILOR.</b></p>


<p class="drop-cap2">MRS LEDDAM&#8217;S prospects began
from this time to brighten, through
the kindness of Captain Sam, and of the
gentleman whose horse John had caught.</p>

<p>The captain interested a friend in John&#8217;s
behalf, who owned a small schooner which
was called a lighter, and was used to convey
the cargoes of large vessels to the city.
He consented to take the little boy, and
make a man of him, as he said. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was obliged to work hard in all kinds of
weather; but the thought of his mother,
and trust in God, reconciled him to every
hardship. Captain Morgan, his master,
was a kind man, and inclined to be religious.
When the work of the day was
over, they used to sit in the little cabin of
the &#8216;Sally,&#8217; for so the vessel was named,
and, while the captain smoked his pipe,
John read to him in his Bible.</p>

<p>Now, this little boy was doing good all
this time, though he did not think that
such a child as he was could be of service
to any one. The captain had hired a
Spanish sailor to assist him, and to take
charge of the boat when he was absent. This
Antonio was a strange-looking creature.
His skin was very dark, and his hair hung
in black locks over his face. Although he
seemed stern, and could look very fierce
with his large bright eyes, yet beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
his sailor jacket there beat a warm, kind
heart. John soon won the good-will of
the Spaniard by his obedient and pleasant
manners, and as the little boy became attached
to his new friend, he felt anxious
to do him good.</p>

<p>One night, when the captain was away,
Antonio brought the fishing net that he
was netting into the cabin where John was
alone. After they had conversed awhile,
John opened the Bible, and proposed to
read aloud. Antonio knew nothing of religion,
except making the sign of the cross
when he was sick or sad; but still he
called himself a Roman Catholic, and did
not want to hear the Bible read.</p>

<p>&#8216;Just let me read this part,&#8217; said John.
&#8216;Listen, Mr Antonio; it is about fishermen.&#8217;
So, before he could speak, John
began to read in Luke of the calling of
Peter, and the miraculous draught of fishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Antonio became interested, and after that
he made one of the little party in the cabin,
and listened with profit to the word of God.</p>

<p>One fine morning they were lying near
a small island; the bay was smooth as a
mirror, and the trees were reflected, leaf
for leaf, in its bosom. Now and then a
fish would rise to the surface of the water,
take a breath of air, and dive down again.
John amused himself in observing some
wild ducks swimming in the shallow water,
watching for prey with fixed eyes and
grave looks, and he smiled to see their
disappointment when the little fish were
too cunning or too nimble for them. He
was interrupted by Antonio coming out of
the cabin, dressed in his best clothes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, Mr Antonio, where are you
going?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nowhere,&#8217; he replied. &#8216;This is my
saint&#8217;s day.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8216;What&#8217;s that?&#8217; inquired John.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I am named after San Antonio,
and this is his day.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said John, &#8216;I have looked through
the New Testament, and have never found
such a saint there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said Antonio, &#8216;he was not alive
at that time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who made him a saint then?&#8217;</p>

<p>Now, as the sailor had not troubled his
head about the matter, he was puzzled to
find an answer. At last he honestly confessed
he did not know.</p>

<p>&#8216;Suppose he is a saint,&#8217; said John, &#8216;what
good can he do you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;he can pray for
me, and help me when I am in danger.&#8217;</p>

<p>John felt serious when he heard this, and
said, &#8216;In that chapter we read last Sunday,
the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Come unto me all
ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
will give you rest.&#8221; There is nothing said
about coming to St Antonio, or St Anyone;
but, &#8220;Come to me.&#8221; I would rather
trust to the Saviour. Would not you?&#8217;
and as he spoke, he looked affectionately
in his friend&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Antonio did not reply; but he thought
of what had been said, and at night he requested
John to read that chapter to him
again.</p>

<p>But time did not always pass so smoothly
with our young friend. Many an hour did
he spend drenched with rain and shivering
with cold. Often, too, in helping to unload
the vessels, he had to endure rude
usage from the rough sailors and coal porters.
Sometimes his heart was almost
broken; but Antonio took his part, and
comforted him by his kindness.</p>

<p>John tried in every way to show his gratitude;
and when they were permitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
visit the town, he prevailed on his friend
to stay with him at his own home. These
visits were pleasant holidays to John. He
took care to bring a supply of fish with
him, that he might not burden his mother:
and if it happened that they could remain
over the Sunday, he kept so close to Antonio
that he went to church with him all
the day.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant sight to see the sailor,
cleanly dressed, sitting in God&#8217;s house,
listening to the instructions of the Bible;
the young lad at his side watching his
looks with such pleasure and interest, for
of all things John desired most to see his
friend a true Christian. I believe he was
more anxious for this than even to be the
master of a vessel.</p>

<p class="center"><b>BE YE ALSO READY.</b></p>


<p class="drop-cap2">TIME passed on, and John was now a
manly youth of seventeen. He had,
by his good conduct, obtained the confidence
of his employer, and was earning
high wages. He had saved all his money,
that he might be able to buy a share in
the schooner, and Captain Sam prophesied
that he would soon be a captain himself.
His brother Henry had been received into
their employment, and was a smart, affectionate
boy; but he never could rival John
in the affections of Antonio.</p>

<p>When Mrs Leddam looked around her
and saw the blessings that she enjoyed, her
heart was filled with thankfulness; and
she often told the old captain that no one
need doubt the goodness of God to those
who trust in Him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>For several years the family had been
accustomed to take their Christmas dinner
at Captain Sam&#8217;s; and you may be sure
that John and Antonio, who were always
of the party, took care that there was no
want of fine fish and a few wild ducks for
the occasion. One morning, after enjoying
a Christmas festival, they bade farewell
to their friends, and jumping gaily on
board their little vessel, which they called
their home, unfurled the sail and glided
down the bay.</p>

<p>It was a clear, bright December day.
They were bound to a large ship which
Captain Morgan had engaged to unload, and
where he was expecting to meet them.</p>

<p>As they were sailing on pleasantly,
Antonio remarked, &#8216;Boys, I don&#8217;t like the
looks of the sky.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said Henry, &#8216;it is as blue and
bright as it can be.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8216;It will be dark enough before tomorrow,&#8217;
he answered, &#8216;so let us make
more sail; we have a long pull before we
reach the ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>Before sunset, just as they were in
sight of the vessel, the wind, which had
breathed gently from the west, veered
round to the south-east, and began to
blow hard. The water, lately so calm,
soon changed its appearance, and the boat
danced up and down as the waves grew
rough beneath the influence of the wind.
Night came upon them; a cold rain commenced
falling; and as they laboured hard,
hoping to reach the fishing village where
John had lived, the tempest increased, and
they wished in vain for day. But day
never dawned on all that group of friends.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where are we?&#8217; said John, breaking
a long silence. A flash of lightning,
which blazed on the angry waters, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a moment lighted up the scene, answered
his question, by discovering to them a
point of land over which the waves were
violently breaking.</p>

<p>&#8216;There is a cove in there,&#8217; said Antonio,
&#8216;if we could only make it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is full of ugly rocks,&#8217; replied John;
&#8216;I remember the place well.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; returned the sailor, &#8216;I&#8217;ll wait for
another flash, and try for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>John would have dissuaded him, but his
voice was lost in the roar of the tempest.
He felt the boat tremble, as, obeying the
helm, she turned towards the shore; and,
catching hold of Henry&#8217;s arm, he put his lips
to his ear and said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be frightened
if we capsize, but strike out from the boat
and swim.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, brother!&#8217; cried Henry, &#8216;this is
dreadful;&#8217; and he clung to John, who
only had time to say, &#8216;Trust in God, pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to Jesus,&#8217; when the frail vessel was violently
hurled against a sunken rock and
upset. It was a moment of confusion and
struggles for life.</p>

<p>Antonio, who was at home in the water,
only thought of the boys. He called
loudly for them, and heard the voice of
John answering. &#8216;Thank God,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;my own boy is safe; but where is Henry?
In the boat, perhaps, entangled in the
rigging; how shall I find it in this darkness?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Henry, where are you?&#8217; cried John.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;clinging to the
boat; but I am so cold I can&#8217;t hold on
much longer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Keep up your courage,&#8217; said Antonio;
&#8216;I see the boat now, and will be there in a
moment; hold on for your life!&#8217;</p>

<p>A furious gust of wind and rain passed
over them and all was darkness for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
instant. Oh, how long even a moment
seems in such circumstances! When the
blast had swept by, John, who had sustained
himself on a floating tree, endeavoured
once more to find the schooner.
He succeeded, and called out loudly for
his brother. A faint voice responded,
&#8216;Brother! brother! can&#8217;t you save me?&#8217;
and all was silent. For a long time they
remained in the storm calling his name,
but Henry never spoke again.</p>

<p>At last they gave up all hope of saving
him, and swimming to the shore, they
found a fisherman&#8217;s hut, where they obtained
torches, and returned. The first
object they saw was the body of Henry
entangled among the timber with which
the cove was filled. The lighter also was
floating near him.</p>

<p>The storm was abating, and the moon,
breaking through the clouds, threw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
light on the sad scene. While the fisherman
took charge of the boat, John and his
friend brought the lifeless boy to land,
when Antonio tenderly lifted him in his
arms, and carried him to the house. He
bitterly reproached himself for running
into the cove against John&#8217;s advice, but
John tried to console him. As he smoothed
the wet ringlets on his brother&#8217;s brow, and
kissed his cold cheek, he said, &#8216;You did it
for the best, Mr Antonio; if it had been
the will of God to save him, he would have
been alive. I trust he is happy now, for
he loved the blessed Saviour.&#8217;</p>

<p>The next day poor Henry was buried
in the nearest churchyard. We shall not
attempt to describe his mother&#8217;s grief.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h2></div>

<p class="center"><b>JOHN FINDS ANOTHER HENRY.</b></p>


<p class="drop-cap2">A SHORT time after the death of
Henry, as John was walking along
the wharf, he saw a ragged boy, apparently
twelve years of age, leaning idly on a
pile of boards. He was thin, and looked
sad. John remembered his own feelings
when he was left a fatherless boy, and he
felt his heart drawn to him. Going to
him, he asked if he had no work to do.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; replied the lad, &#8216;I wish I had; I
would do anything.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What does your father do for a living?&#8217;
John asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have no father nor mother,&#8217; said the
lad; &#8216;I just stay wherever people will let
me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you like to work for me on
board the schooner yonder?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>His face glowed with pleasure, and he
exclaimed, &#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t I!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is your name?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Harry, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>This settled the matter in John&#8217;s mind.
&#8216;I will take him,&#8217; he thought, &#8216;in dear
Henry&#8217;s place; and, if he be worthy, will
be a brother to him, and mother will teach
him to love God.&#8217;</p>

<p>The bargain was soon made, for the
poor orphan had no one to care where
he went; so, carrying his little bundle
on his arm, he followed his new friend
to the schooner, with a heart as light as
a feather. He was a smart boy, and
soon became useful. John took much
pains to teach him to read and to instruct
him in religion; for Harry did not
know any more of God, or the blessed
Saviour, than do the poor heathen who
have never heard His name. Mrs Leddam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
made him clothes, and treated him with
the affection of a mother. All this kindness
was so new and precious to Harry,
who had been only used to hard words
and cross looks, that his young heart
opened to receive it with gratitude and
joy, just as you may have seen a flower,
almost withered by the drought, revive
beneath a gentle shower, and send out
fresh sweetness again. In the course of
a few months no one would have known
the happy looking Harry to be the ragged
and sickly boy that John had met on the
wharf. Harry had an Irish heart, and
he repaid John&#8217;s kindness with warm
affection. He was afraid of Antonio&#8217;s
black eyes at first, but he soon learned to
love the kind Spaniard. Thus they were
a happy little party on board the &#8216;Sally,&#8217;
because they all loved God and each other.</p>

<p>It was a fine day in June that John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
went with Antonio and Harry to visit his
brother&#8217;s grave. His mother wished to go
with them, but John persuaded her not to
do so, fearing that it would renew her
sorrow. They found the place without
difficulty. The oak trees were green and
beautiful, and the mound of earth where
Henry lay was already covered with rich
verdure, and adorned with wild violets,
white and blue, lifting their modest heads
among the tall grass. The water rippled
softly near the churchyard, and all looked
so calm and lovely, that John could
scarcely believe that this was the very
spot where he had struggled so hard for
life, and where, amid the roaring of the
waters, poor Henry had sunk in death.</p>

<p>He could not help shedding tears as he
stood by the grave; but when he remembered
what the Bible says, he was comforted,
and said, &#8216;Henry will rise again.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>&#8216;Will he?&#8217; said Harry, who was standing
by his side.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, the word of God says that we
shall all rise from our graves at the last
day;&#8217; then, taking from his pocket his
Bible, they seated themselves beneath a
tree, while John read 1 Cor. xv. 52: &#8216;For
the trumpet shall sound, and the dead
shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
be changed.&#8217; Then he turned to the first
Epistle to the Thessalonians: &#8216;For the
Lord himself shall descend from heaven,
with the voice of the archangel, and with
the trump of God; and the dead in Christ
shall rise first.&#8217;</p>

<p>Harry listened with attention till John
ceased reading, then he asked him, &#8216;Did
that little boy love God?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, he prayed to God every day, and
was so mild and humble, that we all
thought him a child of Jesus. Oh! what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a comfort it is when we look at his grave,
to think that he will rise from it a glorious
body, like our Saviour&#8217;s; for the Bible
tells us that &#8220;He shall change our vile
body, that it may be fashioned like unto
His glorious body.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>Kneeling by the grave, they prayed that
they might be faithful servants of Christ,
and rest in peace at last. Then, unmooring
their little vessel, they unfurled the sails,
the breeze wafting them swiftly to the town.</p>

<p>When they knelt in family worship that
night, John and his mother wept as they
thought of the dear one who was sleeping
in the lonely churchyard; but they did
not weep as those who had no hope. As
for Harry, he prayed earnestly that God
would give him a new heart, that he
might be His child; and he thanked His
heavenly Father for placing him with
kind and good people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h2></div>

<p class="center"><b>THE POOR PRODIGAL SON.</b></p>


<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT this time our young friend
met with a singular adventure. He
had been taught by his pastor, by reading
the Bible, and, above all, by the teachings
of the Holy Spirit, that if we love
Christ, that love will make us wish to do
good to others, and seek to bring them
to the Saviour. It was John&#8217;s constant
prayer that God would give him something
to do for Christ. Now, when we
offer such a prayer in sincerity, it will be
answered. We have seen that even when
a young boy, John was taught to be useful
to Antonio and his brother Henry; and as
he grew older, his opportunities for doing
good increased. My young reader, is there
no one to whom you can do some good?
Do you love the Lord Jesus yourself?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
This is the first and most important question;
for if you are not a child of God,
you cannot be useful to others,&mdash;indeed,
you will do harm, and thus have a dreadful
account to give at the day of judgment.</p>

<p>But to return to John&#8217;s adventure. In
the marshes at the mouth of the bay, there
are great quantities of wild ducks. Many
persons are employed in the winter season
in shooting these birds, to supply the city
market. They go out in small boats in
pursuit of the game.</p>

<p>John often met with these duck hunters;
but as they were not always profitable companions,
he avoided them, remembering
that the Bible says, &#8216;Evil communications
corrupt good manners.&#8217;</p>

<p>It happened, however, that being obliged
to lie at anchor, to make some little repairs
to his rigging, he stopped where a small
river emptied itself into the bay. Two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
three huts had been built to shelter the
hunters; for this was a favourite resort of
the wild fowl.</p>

<p>As John was busy splicing ropes, a man,
paddling a skiff, came alongside, and hailed
him with, &#8216;My lad, have you any medicine
aboard? I wish you would let me have
some for a sick man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What kind do you want?&#8217; John inquired.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I suppose it don&#8217;t matter much;
one kind is as good as another. But perhaps
you would come yourself and see our
young man, he seems very bad.&#8217;</p>

<p>John did not hesitate; and taking a
medicine chest, which he always kept with
him, he jumped into the skiff, and in a
few moments was at the side of the sick
person.</p>

<p>Stretched on a hard and dirty pallet, in
a damp, comfortless hovel, there lay a fine-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
youth of eighteen, raving with
fever, calling continually on his father and
mother to come to him.</p>

<p>Several young men passed through the
room, but they seemed reckless and dissipated,
and their noisy mirth increased the
delirium of the sufferer.</p>

<p>John seated himself by the bed, and
taking the sick man&#8217;s hand, spoke kindly
to him in a gentle voice. How powerful is
the force of kindness! Those calm words
soothed the mind of the youth, and he remained
more quiet, while John endeavoured
to discover his disease. Exposure
and neglect, it seemed, had brought on a
fever, which threatened to be fatal. John
gave him some medicine, bathed his burning
temples, smoothed his pillow, and
fanned him until he sank to sleep. Antonio
brought from the schooner some tea
which he prepared; and before night they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
had the satisfaction of seeing him more
comfortable. It was not John&#8217;s way to do
things by halves; and seeing that the poor
sufferer could have no attention from his
associates, and would probably die if neglected,
he sent Antonio on with the vessel,
while he remained with his sick charge.
The remedies which he had administered
soon broke the fever; and now that the
patient was calm, he learned his history.</p>

<p>Edward Reeder had been brought up
by pious parents; but falling into evil
company, he had been induced to leave
his father&#8217;s house, and in company with
a band of reckless youths, came out in this
enterprise. But now he saw his sin and
folly, and how frail a dependence is the
friendship of the wicked.</p>

<p>As his young friend read and talked
with him he shed tears of repentance, and
begged John to take him away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
scene of dissipation and wretchedness into
which he had brought himself.</p>

<p>As soon as he was able to bear it, John
and Antonio carried him to the skiff, and
thus brought him on board the &#8216;Sally.&#8217;
The sea breezes restored him in a few
days, and then John took him to his
mother, that by her good nursing his cure
might be completed.</p>

<p>Edward returned to his parents, much
wiser and better than when he left his home.
Neither he nor his family ever forgot the
kindness of John. He called him his deliverer;
and every year a handsome present
was sent to the family in token of gratitude.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h2></div>

<p class="center"><b>&#8216;GIVE AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU.&#8217;</b></p>


<p class="drop-cap2">I &nbsp; HAVE mentioned that it was John&#8217;s
great desire to own the schooner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which he had passed so much of his time.
He loved every plank in the &#8216;Sally,&#8217; and
had hoped that, by the time he was twenty-five,
he would be able to buy out the owner.</p>

<p>But though he had laid by every penny
that he could spare, he found that he had
not half the amount which was required;
and what made him feel more discouraged,
Captain Morgan wished to sell the vessel
immediately, as he intended to retire.</p>

<p>John might have made money much
faster if he would have worked on the
Sabbath, as he saw many do who were in
the same business, without any scruples.
But he knew that the blessing of God
would never rest on those who broke His
commandment; and he valued that blessing
more than gold and silver. He felt
disappointed, but tried to be submissive to
the will of God, and to go on in the discharge
of his duty. &#8216;I have been happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
here,&#8217; he thought; &#8216;but if God&#8217;s blessing
be with me, if I live near to my Saviour,
I will be happy wherever I am placed.&#8217;
Then, as he noticed the lighter scudding
gracefully before the wind, he sighed and
said, &#8216;I shall be grieved to part with my
pretty boat.&#8217;</p>

<p>His mind was filled with such thoughts as
he lay-to, by the side of a ship which had just
arrived, laden with passengers and goods.</p>

<p>As there was some delay in the arrival
of the steamboat, several of the passengers
employed John to convey them to the town.
Among them John observed an elderly
gentleman, who looked pale and feeble.
With his usual kindness, the young man
stepped forward and assisted the stranger
down the side of the ship, and when he
was on board the lighter, John wrapped
his cloak around him, to protect him from
the keen air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>They were soon under weigh for the
town. While they were sailing along, the
stranger, looking up, observed the flag
floating from the top of the mast, on which
was inscribed the name of the schooner.
&#8216;The &#8220;Sally!&#8221;&#8217; he said; &#8216;that name is very
familiar to me. Pray, sir,&#8217; turning to
John, who was at the helm, &#8216;what is your
name?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;John Leddam, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mine is Reeder, and you must be
Edward&#8217;s friend.&#8217;</p>

<p>They met like old friends, and Mr
Reeder soon made himself acquainted with
John&#8217;s troubles. He inquired how much
money he needed to make up the whole
sum for the purchase of the schooner.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, sir,&#8217; said John, &#8216;a large amount; it
will take me three years at least, with good
business, to earn it. I could borrow, but I
never will run in debt. I wish to go by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the Bible rule, &#8220;Owe no man anything,
but to love one another.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>The old gentleman smiled, but said nothing.</p>

<p>A day or two after this conversation
Captain Morgan came to him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, John, the &#8220;Sally&#8221; is yours; your
friend Mr Reeder will advance the money.
He says that he owes you much more than
this for saving the life of his son.&#8217;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h2></div>

<p class="center"><b>THE CONCLUSION.</b></p>

<p class="center">&#8216;Thou shalt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
stayed on Thee.&#8217;</p>


<p class="drop-cap2">THE joyful day arrived at last when
our friend John was rewarded for his
industry and honesty. He was the owner
and commander of the &#8216;Sally.&#8217; Captain
Sam was so gratified that he gave a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
dinner on the occasion. But there was
no one more pleased with John&#8217;s fair prospects
than his friend Antonio. He gave
thanks aloud in the fulness of his heart,
clasped John in his arms, hugged Harry,
and at last fairly cried for joy. The old
sailor did not, however, long enjoy the
pleasure of working under his young captain.
Being exposed to a heavy rain, he
took a severe cold, which settled on his
lungs; and when spring came, with its
sweet breezes and warm sun, Antonio was
not able to enjoy them.</p>

<p>John brought him home, where his
mother and sisters nursed him tenderly
through his long illness, and he devoted to
him all the time he could spare from his
business; for it revived the sick man&#8217;s
spirits to see John&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Many an hour through the summer did
the young man pass by the bedside of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
suffering Christian, reading to him the
precious promises of God, and uniting
with him in praise and prayer.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was you,&#8217; said Antonio, &#8216;that showed
me the way to Jesus. Oh! that reading
of the Bible&mdash;it was my salvation!&#8217;</p>

<p>When the leaves began to fall before
the winds of autumn, the old sailor was
called home to rest. In his last moments
he clasped the hand of John, and employed
his dying breath in blessing his &#8216;own boy,&#8217;
as he had always called his young friend.</p>

<p>John followed Antonio to the grave
with sincere grief. He erected a stone
to his memory. It had only his name
&#8216;Antonio&#8217; engraven on it, but that was
sufficient for John&#8217;s heart; and there was
no one else to care for the poor sailor who
rested in that humble grave. But precious
in the sight of the Lord is the death
of His saints. However humble may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the Christian&#8217;s lot on earth, or obscure his
last resting-place, he has a happy home in
heaven. A few moments in that blessed
world will make us forget all the sorrows
of a long life of trouble.</p>

<p>John, or Captain John as he is now
called, still sails in the &#8216;Sally,&#8217; and has as
much work as he can do. He has bought
a comfortable house in a pleasant suburb,
where he has settled his mother and sisters.
It is painted white, and the porch is shaded
with sweet roses. It looks like a cottage
of content, and it is so indeed. Mrs Leddam
and John do not forget their dear
Henry, nor their old friend Antonio, but
they hope to meet them at last; and while
they enjoy their quiet home, they often
unite their hearts and voices in thanking
that merciful God who had thus kindly
guided and blessed the poor fatherless
boy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WHAT A LITTLE BOY CAN DO.</h2></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i058.jpg" width="100" height="113" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8216;I WISH, I wish, I wish,&#8217; said a
little boy, who awoke early
one morning, and lay in bed
thinking; &#8216;I wish I was grown up,
so as to do some good. If I was
governor, I&#8217;d make good laws; or I&#8217;d
be a missionary; or I&#8217;d get rich, and give away
so much to poor people; but I am only a little
boy, and it will take me plenty of years to
grow up.&#8217; Was he going to put off doing good
till then? &#8216;Well,&#8217; he said to himself while he
was dressing, &#8216;I know what I CAN do. I can
be good; that&#8217;s left to little boys.&#8217; Therefore,
when he was dressed, he knelt and asked God
to help him to be good, and try to serve Him
all day with all his heart, and not <small>FORGET</small>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Then he went down stairs to finish his
lessons.</p>

<p>No sooner was he seated with his clean slate
before him, than his mother called him to run
into the wood-house for his little brother. He
did not want to leave his lesson, yet he cheerfully
said, &#8216;I&#8217;ll go, mother;&#8217; and away he ran.
And how do you think he found &#8216;bubby?&#8217;
With a sharp axe in his hand. &#8216;I chop,&#8217; he
said; and quite likely the next moment he
would have chopped off his little toes. The
little boy only thought of minding his mother;
but who can tell if his ready obedience did not
save his baby brother from being a cripple for
life?</p>

<p>As he was going on an errand for his mother,
he saw a poor woman whose foot had slipped
on the newly-made ice, and she fell; and in
falling she had spilled her bag of beans and
basket of apples, and some wicked boys were
snatching up her apples and running off with
them. The little boy stopped and said, &#8216;Let
me help you to pick up your beans and apples,&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and his nimble fingers quickly helped her out
of her mishap. He only thought of being
kind; he did not know how his kind act comforted
the poor woman long after she got
home, and how she prayed God to bless him.</p>

<p>At dinner, as his father and mother were
talking, his father said roughly, &#8216;I shan&#8217;t do
anything for that man&#8217;s son; the old man
always did his best to injure me.&#8217; &#8216;But,
father,&#8217; said the little boy, looking up into his
father&#8217;s face, &#8216;does not the Bible say we must
return good for evil?&#8217; The little boy did not
know that his father thought of what his son
had said all the afternoon, and said within
himself, &#8216;My boy is more of a Christian than
I am; I must be a better man.&#8217;</p>

<p>When he came home from school at night,
he went to the cage and found his dear canary-bird
dead. &#8216;Oh, mother! and I tended birdie
so, and I loved him so, and he sang so sweetly;&#8217;
and the little boy burst into tears over his
poor favourite. &#8216;Who gave birdie&#8217;s life, and
who took it again?&#8217; asked his mother, stroking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his head. &#8216;God,&#8217; he answered through his
tears, &#8216;and He knows best;&#8217; and he tried to
hush himself.</p>

<p>A lady sat in a dark corner in the room.
She had lost her two birdies; and though she
hoped they had taken angels&#8217; wings and gone
to nestle in the heavenly land, she would rather
have her little sons back to her nest again.
But when she beheld the little boy&#8217;s patience
and submission to his Father in heaven, she
said, &#8216;I too will trust Him, like this little
child.&#8217; Her heart was touched, and she went
home with a little spring of healing gushing
up there, and she became henceforth a better
mother to the children yet left to her.</p>

<p>When the little boy lay on his pillow that
night, he thought, &#8216;I am too small to do any
good; but oh, I do want to be good, and to
love the Saviour who came down from heaven
to die for me. I do want to become one of
the heavenly Father&#8217;s dear children.&#8217;</p>

<p>The heavenly Father&#8217;s children are sometimes
called children of light; and does it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
seem as if beams of light shone from this little
child, warming, blessing everybody that came
in his way? Who will say he did not do
good?</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
